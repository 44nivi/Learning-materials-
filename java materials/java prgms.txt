1.Design a class named ShowRoom with the following description:

Instance variables/data members:

String name: to store the name of the customer.
long mobno: to store the mobile number of the customer.
double cost: to store the cost of the items purchased.
double dis: to store the discount amount.
double amount: to store the amount to be paid after discount.

Member methods:

ShowRoom(): default constructor to initialize data members.
void input(): to input customer name, mobile number, cost.
void calculate(): to calculate discount on the cost of purchased items, based on the following criteria:

COST                                                      DISCOUNT (IN PERCENTAGE)

Less than or equal to Rs. 10000                           5%
More than Rs. 10000 and less than or equal to Rs. 20000   10%
More than Rs. 20000 and less than or equal to Rs. 35000   15%
More than Rs. 35000                                       20%

void display(): to display customer name, mobile number, amount to be paid after discount.
Write a main() method to create an object of the class and call the above member methods.

2.write a java program to Design a class to overload a function series() as follows:
a)void series(int p): to display the following series:
0, 7, 26, 63, … p terms.

b) void series(): to display the sum of the series given below:
1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + … + 1/10.

3.Write a program to accept name and total marks of N number of 
students in two single subscripts array name[] and totalmarks[].

Calculate and print:
(i) The average of the total marks obtained by N number of students.
[average = (sum of total marks of all the students) / N]
(ii) Deviation of each student’s total marks with the average.
[deviation = total marks of a student – average].
